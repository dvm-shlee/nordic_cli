# Python module and CLI Tool for NORDIC

This repository contains a python function and ~~command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Python~~ for executing functions of the NIFTI_NORDIC powered by MATLAB compiler SDK. The addition of python wrapper are made under the terms of the original license, and the software is intended for educational and research purposes only.

The original Matlab code, and the DEMO files can be found in the MATLAB subfolder. The CLI tool is compiled with MATLAB 2023a, and thus requires the Matlab runtime version 9.14. It is compatible with Python versions 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.

In order to run the CLI tool, you need to properly set up the MATLAB runtime in your environment. Instructions for installing the MATLAB runtime can be found [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-the-matlab-runtime.html), and instructions for configuring the MATLAB runtime are available [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/mcr-path-settings-for-run-time-deployment.html).

Please note that all products compiled with the MATLAB compiler are copyright MathWorks, Inc. Please abide by their licensing terms when using this software.

# Usage
```python
import nordic

# magnitude only
nordic.run('./sample.nii.gz', 
           'output.nii.gz',
           modality="fMRI",
           kernel_size_gfactor=[10, 10, 1],
           kernel_size_pca=[5, 5, 5])

# with phase image
nordic.run('./sample.nii.gz',
           'output.nii.gz',
           phase_path = "./phase.nii.gz',
           modality="fMRI",
           kernel_size_gfactor=[10, 10, 1])

# Original Software: NORDIC_Raw
Matlab code for performing image reconstruction in MRI and performing the NORDIC denoising.
Needs matlab version 2017b or newer

# Overview
The two files NORDIC and NIFTI_NORDIC perform similar concepts, locally low-rank denoising.
Both approaches, uses a g-factor map to flatten the noise, and a noise-scan for estimating the homoegenous noise.
For NORDIC, the noise-scan and the g-factor are explicit constructions provided as the last elements in a 4D array.
For NIFTI_NORDIC, these are estimated based on the data. The construction for estimating the g-factor noise and the thermal noise level
uses the MPPCA method of Veraart et al. 2016
NIFTI_NORDIC has additional paramters that can be adjusted, for learning or understanding the influence of the different algortimic choices.
For NIFTI_NORDIC, there are two different options, depending on whether dMRI or fMRI is used. 
This difference appears related to the hwo the phase is retained in the DICOM of the vendor software. A corresponding distinction is not neccesary for the NORDIC processing.

This version of NIFTI_NORDIC has been made possible through the testing and evaulation of many people, including

# System Requirements
# Hardware Requirements
Package only requires a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations and loading the data
# Software Requirements
 This package is tested on Matlab version 2017b. All neccesary dependencies are part of the default matlab installation
# Installation Guide
 Ensure that NORDIC.m is in a path that is visible to matlab
# Demo for the installation
   Using the NORDIC.m function and the simulation in DEMO, the following will demonstrate hwo to use NORDIC

    script_for_creating_simulation_data
    NORDIC('demo_data_for_NORDIC.mat')
    
    QQ=load('KSP_demo_data_for_NORDICkernel8')
    Q=load('demo_data_for_NORDIC') 
    figure; clf
    subplot(2,2,1); imagesc(squeeze(real(Q.KSP(:,:,32,12))),[0 1]); title('Data + noise')
    subplot(2,2,2); imagesc(squeeze(real(Q.IMG(:,:,32,12))),[0 1]); title('Data w/o noise')
    subplot(2,2,3); imagesc(squeeze(real(QQ.KSP_update(:,:,32,12))),[0 1]); title('NORDIC processed')
    subplot(2,2,4); plot(squeeze(real(Q.KSP(20,25,32,1:end-2)  -   Q.IMG(20,25,32,1:end-1)))), hold on
                    plot(squeeze(real(QQ.KSP_update(20,25,32,1:end)  -   Q.IMG(20,25,32,1:end-1))))
                    legend('difference before NORDIC','difference after NORDIC')
